# roam-depot-tweet-extract
        
  Roam Research Plugin to extract saved tweet text into your graph. 
  Save tweets in your graph but wish they were searchable?

  To set up the format of your extracted tweet a simple template system is included, found in the Roam Depot plugin settings panel. For each supported `{OPTION}` the variable will be replaced with the extracted tweet information.

  Options available to the template are `{TWEET}`, `{URL}`, `{AUTHOR_NAME}`, `{AUTHOR_URL}`, `{DATE}`, `{NEWLINE}`.  A default temlpate is included.

  `[[>]] {TWEET} {NEWLINE} [üê¶]({URL}) by {AUTHOR_NAME} on [[{DATE}]]`
  

  
  To trigger the tweet extraction you have two options: Right click plugin or keyboard shortcut

  To trigger via a keyboard shortcut click into the block and hit a `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `E`. (will be remapable soon)

  Roam Research Plugin to extract saved tweet text into your graph. 
  
  *NOTE: Because of recent changes to Twitter's API, image extraction has temporarily been disabled*
  
  To set up the format of your extracted tweet a simple template system is included, found in the Roam Depot plugin settings panel. For each supported `{OPTION}` the variable will be replaced with the extracted tweet information.

  Options available to the template are `{TWEET}`, `{URL}`, `{AUTHOR_NAME}`, `{AUTHOR_HANDLE}`, `{AUTHOR_URL}`, `{DATE}`, `{NEWLINE}`, `{IMAGES}`.  A default temlpate is included.

  `[[>]] {TWEET} {NEWLINE} [üê¶]({URL}) by {AUTHOR_HANDLE} on [[{DATE}]]`
  


  To trigger the tweet extraction you have two options: Right click plugin or keyboard shortcut

  To trigger via a keyboard shortcut click into the block and hit a `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `E`. (will be remapable soon)

## Added Info
To extract images from tweets a simple custom CORS proxy has been utalized. There is _zero_ private data to be concerned about in using the included instance. Only the public tweet URL is sent through the proxy. 

Click the button below and you will get a Glitch Remix of the proxy if you would like to check out the code.
